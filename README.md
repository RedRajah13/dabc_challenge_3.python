Module 3 - Python homework

This challenge includes two separate files. One analyses a bank's profit over 86 months using for loops, conditionals, and formatting to print out a comprehensive summary of the data. The second counts votes for several candidates in a state, using the same tactics as the bank analysis plus dictionaries, and prints each candidate's number of votes, their percentage of the total votes, and the winner of the election.
